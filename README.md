# Introduction and purpose
### HTML and CSS practice
This repository is an experimental for CSS course. By creating a clone of the Instagram login page.

I have used HTML5 and CSS3 for this page.
## Instagram login page
The `index.html` includes HTML tags and `mycss.css` in css folder contains the styling for the page.

To make the webpage responsive and to display properly on different devices. I've used the code below for __HTML__:

```HTML
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no">
```
to make sure that HTML scales.

and for __CSS3__:

```CSS
@media screen and (max-width: 960px) {
  .side{
    display: none;
  }
}
```
This removes the Phone base picture when the browser size is below 960px.

it should be looking like this:
